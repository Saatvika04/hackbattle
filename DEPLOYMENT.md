   # Enable Developer mode
   # Click "Load unpacked"
   # Select extension directory
   

## Email Backend Service (Optional)

To enable email reports, you'll need a backend service:

### Option 1: Simple Email Service

javascript
// Example backend endpoint for email reports
app.post('/api/send-report', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, reportData } = req.body;
  
  // Send email using service like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.
  await emailService.send({
    to: email,
    subject: 'Your Weekly Focus Report',
    template: 'weekly-report',
    data: reportData
  });
  
  res.json({ success: true });
});


### Option 2: Serverless Function

Deploy using Netlify Functions, Vercel, or AWS Lambda:

javascript
// netlify/functions/send-email.js
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  // Handle email sending logic
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ success: true })
  };
};
