# Extension Icons

For the Chrome extension to work properly, you need to add icon files in the following sizes:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels)  
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The icons should represent a focus/target theme to match the FocusTracker branding.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares until you design proper icons.

Alternatively, you can download free icons from sites like:
- Icons8 (https://icons8.com)
- Flaticon (https://flaticon.com)
- Material Design Icons (https://material.io/resources/icons/)

Make sure the icons are PNG format and match the exact dimensions listed above.
