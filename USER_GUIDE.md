## üìä Understanding Your Data

### Focus Score Calculation
Your focus score is calculated using this formula:
```
Focus Score = (Productive Time Ratio - Distraction Penalty) √ó 100
```

**Category Classifications:**
- **Productive**: Development, Learning, Research, Communication
- **Distracting**: Entertainment, Social Media, News  
- **Neutral**: Everything else (doesn't affect score)

**Example:**
- 4 hours productive work + 1 hour social media + 1 hour other = 67% focus score
- Calculation: (4/6 - min(1/6, 0.3)) √ó 100 = (0.67 - 0.17) √ó 100 = 50%
